The Internet Jukebox is a simple networking device, comprising of a Rasberry Pi connected to the Internet (e.g., through a 3G dongle), a WiFi dongle that leads those connected to a local captive portal, and an external hard disk. 
The main difference of the Internet Jukebox, compared to other similar technologies is that the content to be downloaded from its thin Internet connection is decided collaboratively between those that will consume it, unlike for example the case of the Outernet (https://www.outernet.is/en/).
<br/>
<br/>

The selection of the content happens in two separate (but possible parallel) phases: search and download. In the <b>search phase</b>, users search for content in the Internet (through a specific set of supported search engines) and choose amongst the results the content that they would like to download, forming a list of desirable content to vote upon. In the <b>download phase</b>, users can place their votes until the download deadline. When the deadline arrives, the most popular content is downloaded and possibly projected in place, in the (typical) case when most users do not have a personal device.

The Internet Jukebox is developed at ETH Zurich by Abdullah Alhussainy, Dr. Panayotis Antoniadis, and Dr. Karin Anna Hummel under the supervision of Prof. Bernhard Plattner. The work was funded by the Sawiris Scholoarship "Bringing Internet Access to Disconnected Populations of Developing Countries with Smartphones and Opportunistic Communications".
